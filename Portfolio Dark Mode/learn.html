        Web Development!
    </h1>
    <p>
        A web developer is a person who takes web design and required functionalities – as per the client or product
        team – and
        turns it into a website.

        A Web Developer holds an important position in a company as he/she has to use a language from the client and
        convert it
        into a language that a computer understands i.e. HTML.

        As you can imagine, web development requires a lot of effort and time along with an intricate understanding of
        how
        various components of web development work to stay ahead of your competitors.
    </p>

    <p>
        Seeing the progressive development in web technology, it’s a pretty good place to be. The companies are
        constantly
        looking out for new talent that gives the aspiring developers a chance to find their perfect role.
    </p>

    <p>
        With emerging trends in technologies, Web Development has now become one of the most chosen fields by students
        or corporate employees. The ones involved from non-technical backgrounds are also thriving for the knowledge
        gained in Web Development to be able to flourish in that field and support the Technological Economy.
