                <br>
                Alfred Amour Garnier founded the company in Blois, Paris, in 1904, with a primary focus on using natural
                substances for
                hair treatment. With time, the company broadened its product line to include skincare and joined a
                worldwide market.
                Garnier is adamant about its
                opinion that
                nature provides the best self-care solutions. This concept supports Garnier's reputation for offering
                eco-friendly and
                successful beauty products, appealing to customers all over the world who value sustainability and
                efficacy in their
                skincare routines.

            <p><SPAN id="heading">MISSION</SPAN>
                <br>With seven main product categories, Garnier has grown from its modest 1904 start to become a
                well-known body care
                company worldwide. Garnier is still dedicated to offering premium body care products at reasonable
                prices, and it offers
                a wide variety of treatments designed to meet different customer needs. Garnier, who embraces diversity,
                thinks that
                everyone should have access to the best self-care possible without going over budget.

                <br>Garnier is dedicated to reducing its environmental effect in addition to its aesthetic appeal. In
                keeping with its
                sustainable philosophy, the company always considers biodegradability while creating product formulae
                and packaging.
                Garnier makes environmental responsibility a top priority in order to lessen its environmental impact
                while still
                offering high-quality cosmetic products.
